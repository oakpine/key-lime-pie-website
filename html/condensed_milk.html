        <h2>Sweetened Condensed Milk</h2>
        <p>Condensed milk is made by removing most of the water from a cow's milk, resulting in a dense, syrupy liquid. Sugar is also added, giving the condensed cow's milk a sweet taste and allowing for a longer shelf life. The liquid is collected and canned.</p>

        <p>This product was originally developed in France, but it began to spread to other places. Now, it can be made and bought anywhere in the world.</p>
